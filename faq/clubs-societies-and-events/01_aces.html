<h5>Introduction to ACES</h5>
<p>
  ACES is recognized to be the official student body of the computer engineering undergraduates of
  the Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya. Its objective is on par with the
  Department’s vision which is “To be a competitive entity in teaching and research in Computer
  Engineering in the country and the region and to produc e graduates with international recognition
  for their knowledge and skills, capable of taking leadership positions in the science and
  technology of design, construction, implementation, and maintenance of software and hardware
  components of modern computing systems and computer controlled equipment that constitute the
  discipline of Computer Engineering”. The Association of Computer Engineering Students (ACES) was
  formed in August, 2001 with the aim of maximising students’ potential by organising different
  activities and events that would bring out the best within themselves and make them prepared for
  the next technological revolution.
</p>

<p>
  With time, ACES has become one of the most active student bodies in the University. Various events
  are organised throughout the year by ACES with the perpetual support and encouragement of the
  highly qualified academic staff members of the departments in order to bring forth the innovative
  ideas of the undergraduates and empower them. ACES Hackathon, ACES Coders, Computer Engineering
  Seminars, ‘Spark’ (school program), ‘Nenathambara’ (school program) and ACES AI Hackfest are some
  of the annually organised events by ACES.
</p>

<p>
  ACES Hackathon is one of the major competitions held by ACES to encourage innovative
  undergraduates. ACES Coders is another major event that is popular as the biggest coding
  competition in Sri Lanka. Apart from them, ACES organises a career fair and a symposium named
  ‘ESCaPe’ especially targeting the final year undergraduates. ACES supports computer engineering
  undergraduates through various projects bridging the gap between academia and the industry.
</p>

<p>
  Our social events are an opportunity for you to take a break from studying. In the past we’ve run
  soft skills development workshops and batch trips along with entertaining events such as ‘Padura’
  musical night.
</p>

<p>
  All these events have been successfully carried out with the intention of enhancing the knowledge
  and the quality of the undergraduates.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout the years, ACES has actively contributed in building a platform to improve the skills
  of the computer engineering students with the collaboration of the industry and the department’s
  proud alumni. The successful results of the past years’ efforts of ACES are brought out clearly
  through the excellent performance of the students who have exhibited outstanding talents in
  multiple disciplines related to the computer engineering domain both on national and international
  levels.
</p>

<p>
  ACES, which has come a long way since its humble beginnings, will continue to strive for success
  with the collective effort of the students, academic staff, alumni and the industry with the
  intention of unveiling the best version of the department and its students. You are welcome to
  join us!
