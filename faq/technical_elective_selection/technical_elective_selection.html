    <question>
        What are technical electives in the PeraCom degree programme?
    </question>

    <answer>
        <p>PeraCom technical electives are courses that are specific to the field of computer engineering and are
            offered as part of the undergraduate curriculum for the program. These courses include topics from
            disciplines such as software engineering, systems, computer networks, and artificial intelligence. They are
            typically optional courses that students can choose to take in addition to the core courses in the program.
            The purpose of technical electives is to allow students to specialize in a particular area of computer
            engineering and gain a more in-depth understanding of a specific topic.</p>

    <question>
        What is the difference between a core course and an elective?
    </question>

    <answer>
        <p>Core courses and elective courses are different types of courses that are typically offered in undergraduate
            programs.
            <br><br>
            Core courses are required courses that all students in a particular program must take. These courses are
            intended to provide students with a strong foundation in the subject matter and to develop essential skills.
            They are typically focused on the main concepts and theories of the program and are usually mandatory to
            graduate.
            <br><br>
            Elective courses, on the other hand, are courses that students can choose to take but are not required.
            These courses are intended to allow students to explore specific areas of interest or to gain additional
            knowledge in specialized areas. Elective courses are often offered as a way for students to diversify their
            knowledge and skills, to tailor their education to their personal or career goals, or to fulfill certain
            degree requirements.

        What factors need to be considered when selecting a technical elective?
    </question>

    <answer>
        <p>When selecting a technical elective in a computer engineering program, several factors should be considered:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Relevance to your career goals: Consider which electives align with your desired career path. For
                example, if you want to specialize in machine learning, you may want to take an elective in artificial
                intelligence. </li>
            <li>Prerequisites: Make sure that you have the necessary background to take the elective. Some electives may
                have prerequisites that you need to have completed before you can enroll.
            </li>
            <li>Faculty: Research the faculty who will be teaching the elective. Look at their research interests and
                publications to get a sense of their expertise in the field.
            </li>
            <li>Course content: Look at the course syllabus to get a sense of what topics will be covered in the
                elective. If possible, read the textbook or other materials to get a better sense of the course.
            </li>
            <li>Class schedule: Consider the schedule of the elective, including the time of day and frequency of
                meetings, to ensure that it fits into your schedule.
            </li>
            <li>Availability: Some electives may have limited availability or be offered only once a year, so plan
                accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>Resources: Check if the elective has any resources such as lab or software, that will help you to be
                successful in the elective and that you have access to them.
            </li>
            <li>Personal interest: Consider your interests. If you are passionate about a specific area of computer
                engineering, you may want to take an elective in that area even if it may not align with your career
                goals.
            </li>
            <li>Feedback from other students: Talk to other students who have taken the elective or check online student
                reviews to get a sense of the course content and difficulty level, as well as the teaching style of the
                instructor.
            </li>
            <li>Graduation requirements: Check the graduation requirements of your program to make sure that the
                elective will count towards your degree. Some electives may only count as elective credit, while others
                may be required for your program.
            </li>
            <li>Credit hours: Consider the number of credit hours required for the elective. Some electives may require
                more credit hours than others, so plan accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>Curriculum updates: Check if the elective course is being updated or replaced with new ones, taking the
                updated version may be beneficial.
            </li>
            <li>Hands-on experience: Look for electives that offer hands-on experience with real-world projects or
                industry partnerships. This can give you valuable skills and insights that will be useful in your future
                career.
            </li>
            <li>Research opportunities: See if the elective offers any research opportunities. This can give you a
                chance to work with a professor on a research project, which can be a great way to gain experience and
                potentially lead to publications or other opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>International opportunities: Check if the elective has any international opportunities, such as study
                abroad programs or international collaborations. This can give you a chance to gain a global perspective
                on your field of study and make valuable connections with professionals from around the world.
            </li>
            <li>online or hybrid format: Check the format of the elective, whether it's online or hybrid, some students
                may prefer one format over the other.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Choosing the right technical elective can greatly enhance your education and career opportunities, so it's
            important to carefully consider all of these factors before making your decision.</p>
