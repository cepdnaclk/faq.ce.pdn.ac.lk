  question="How to connect to this server?"
  answer="The methodology is very similar to how we would connect to kepler.ce.pdn.ac.lk or turing.ce.pdn.ac.lk.

  The only difference is ampere.ce.pdn.ac.lk in place of kepler.ce.pdn.ac.lk.
  Basic ssh connection instructions are <a href = 'https://faq.ce.pdn.ac.lk/network-n-servers/kepler/'>here</a> Jupyter notebook, mobaxtrem, and VScode connection information are <a href = 'https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gihan/resources/pdn-hpc/'>here</a>."
