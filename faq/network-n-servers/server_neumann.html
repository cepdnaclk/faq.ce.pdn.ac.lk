  <question>How can I connect to this server?</question>
  <answer>
    Since Neumann does not have a public IP (internal IP: 10.40.18.20), you can either SSH directly from inside the university network, or
    SSH through Tesla (which has a public IP) from outside the university network.

    <br />
    <br />

    Direct (from inside the university network):
    <br />
    <code class="bash">ssh e14000@10.40.18.20</code>

    Jump through Tesla (from outside):
    <br />
    <code class="bash">ssh -J e14000@tesla.ce.pdn.ac.lk e14000@10.40.18.20</code>
