  <question>How can I connect to this server?</question>
  <answer>
    Since turing.ce.pdn.ac.lk does not have a public IP, you can either SSH directly from inside the university network, or SSH through
    Tesla (which has a public IP) from outside the university network.

    <br />
    <br />
    Direct (from inside the university network):
    <br />
    <b>ssh e14000@turing.ce.pdn.ac.lk</b>
    <br />
    Jump through Tesla (from outside):
    <br />
    <b>ssh -J e14000@tesla.ce.pdn.ac.lk e14000@turing.ce.pdn.ac.lk</b>

  <question>What datasets are hosted in Turing?</question>
  <answer>
    <p>
      We store frequently used datasets inside the turing.ce.pdn.ac.lk local storage for easy access. You can access these by the following
      command:
    </p>

    <code class="bash">ls /storage/datasets/</code>

    <p>
      These datasets are in the read only mode. You can use these datasets as the input for your tasks but you have to output the results to
      your home directory. The following datasets are stored at the moment.
    </p>

    <p>- THIS LIST WILL BE POPULATED SOON</p>
